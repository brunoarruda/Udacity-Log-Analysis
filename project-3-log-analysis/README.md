# Udacity Nanodegree Full Stack Developer

## Project 3 - Log Analysis

In this project, we must manipulate a PostGree database and produce a log file as requested. The database was extracted from real world data application and is [available for downloading](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/August/57b5f748_newsdata/newsdata.zip).

## Setup

The project was done on Windows, so instructions will be given for this plataform. To this date, the latest releases of Vagrant and Oracle VM didn't work with the VM configuration provided by Udacity. Trying combinations I came to this above, that should use the latest working versions:

1. Install [Vagrant v.2.0.0](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.0/)
2. Install [Oracle VM v.5.1.38](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1)
3. Download or clone vagrantfile from [Udacity repo](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm)
4. go to Vagrantfile folder on prompt and run ```vagrant up```. This will set the Virtual Machine and dependencies of the project.
